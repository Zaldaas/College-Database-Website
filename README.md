# College Database Website
The objective of this project is to design and implement a web database application for a university. The database manages information related to professors, departments, courses, sections, students, and enrollments.

The project was initially developed using simple HTML/CSS for the web interface and PHP and SQL scripts for the backend database functionality. 

Now, the project incorporates Vite/React for the frontend and Laravel for the backend, and utilizes XAMPP with Apache and MySQL for the database management.

## Database Creation
Initially, SQL scripts (create_tables.sql and insert_data.sql) were written to create the tables and populate them with sample data. The create_tables.sql script defined the structure of each table, specifying primary keys and foreign keys to enforce relationships. The insert_data.sql script inserted sample records into each table.

Now, the database is created using XAMPP and MySQL. The schema is created using Laravel, and is dynamically updated using REST APIs.


## Web Interface
In the first iteration, a series of PHP scripts as well as an HTML interface script were developed to provide functionalities for different users:
- Students: Students can log in using their campus-wide ID to view their enrolled courses and grades. They can also look up details about specific courses.
- Professors: Professors can log in using their SSN to view the sections they are teaching. They can also view the grades of students in each section.
- Administrators: Administrators can log in to access features similar to both students and professors, including looking up professors, students, courses, and grades.

The interface is now built using Vite/React with Typescript and Bootstrap to provide a more modern and user-friendly experience for the same users.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- XAMPP with MySQL, Apache and PHP: Ensure XAMPP is installed and the MySQL and Apache services are running.
- Composer: Required for managing PHP dependencies.
- Node.js and npm: Needed to run the Vite/React development server.


### Backend Setup (Laravel)
1. Open your terminal and navigate to the college-database-laravel.
   
2. Run the following command to install PHP dependencies:
   ```bash
   composer install
   ```
   
3. Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env`.
     
4. Generate an application key by running:
   ```bash
   php artisan key:generate
   ```
   
5. Ensure your database connection in the `.env` file by updating `DB_HOST`, `DB_DATABASE`, `DB_USERNAME`, and `DB_PASSWORD` as per your MySQL configuration.
   
6. Run database migrations to set up the schema with:
   ```bash
   php artisan migrate
   ```
   
7. Start the Laravel development server with:
   ```bash
   php artisan serve
   ```
   (default URL: http://127.0.0.1:8000)

### Frontend Setup (Vite/React)
1. Navigate to the project root college-database-react.
   
2. Run the following command to install JavaScript dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   
3. Start the Vite development server with:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   (default URL: http://localhost:3000 or http://localhost:5173)

### Accessing the Application
- Open your web browser and go to the Vite/React server URL.
- Use the admin password "password" for administrator access.
